  "about": "Hi! I'm Laufey. I'm a musician, singer, and songwriter who loves blending jazz, classical, and pop to create something nostalgic yet fresh. My goal is to bring jazz and classical music to my generation. I play piano, guitar, and cello, and I sing about love, longing, and little moments in life that feel like scenes from an old film. When I'm not making music, you'll probably find me reading, drinking coffee, or romanticizing life through a rainy window. Nice to meet you!",
